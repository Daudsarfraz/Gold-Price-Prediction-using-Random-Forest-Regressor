## Introduction

Gold is a widely traded precious metal with prices influenced by various economic, political, and market factors. Predicting the price of gold can be valuable for investors, traders, and financial analysts. In this project, we aim to build a predictive model using the Random Forest Regressor algorithm to forecast gold prices based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical gold price data and relevant features. It includes attributes such as date, opening price, closing price, high price, low price, trading volume, etc. The dataset can be obtained from reliable financial data sources or APIs.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the project:

- Python (version 3.7+)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset:

- Obtain the historical gold price data.
- Preprocess the data, handle missing values, and engineer relevant features.

2. Train the model:

- Run the `.Ipynb` script to train the Random Forest Regressor model.
- Specify the input dataset and any required parameters.

3. Make predictions:

- Use the trained model to make predictions on future gold prices.
- Run the `predict.py` script and provide the necessary input data.

## Results

The project aims to provide accurate predictions of gold prices using the Random Forest Regressor algorithm. The performance of the model can be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared.

The results of the predictions can be visualized using graphs, charts, or other relevant visual representations.
